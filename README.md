# Ammonia Decomposition on Metal Surfaces using DFT (Quantum ESPRESSO)

This project explores the decomposition of ammonia (NH₃) on catalytic surfaces such as Ruthenium (Ru), Platinum (Pt), Nickel (Ni), and Cobalt (Co) using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed with Quantum ESPRESSO.

## Project Goals
- Compare adsorption of NH₃ and decomposition intermediates (NH₂, NH, N, H) on Ru, Pt, Ni, and Co surfaces
- Calculate adsorption energies, geometries, and charge transfer
- Analyze surface properties influencing catalytic activity
- Identify trends and rational catalyst design principles

## Catalysts Considered
| Catalyst | Activity | Cost | Stability |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Ru**   | High     | High | High      |
| **Pt**   | Moderate | High | Very High |
| **Ni**   | Moderate | Low  | Medium    |
| **Co**   | Moderate | Low  | Lower     |   | Moderate | Low  | Lower     |
