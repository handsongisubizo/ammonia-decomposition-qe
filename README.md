# Ammonia Decomposition on Metal Surfaces using DFT (Quantum ESPRESSO)

This project explores the decomposition of ammonia (NH₃) on catalytic surfaces such as Ruthenium (Ru), Platinum (Pt), Nickel (Ni), and Cobalt (Co) using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations performed with Quantum ESPRESSO.

## Goals
- Compare adsorption of NH₃ and decomposition intermediates (NH₂, NH, N, H) on Ru, Pt, Ni, and Co surfaces
- Calculate adsorption energies, geometries, and charge transfer
- Analyze surface properties influencing catalytic activity
- Identify trends 

## Methodology
- Software: Quantum ESPRESSO 
- Functional: [to be specified]
- Pseudopotentials: [to be specified]
- Slabs: [to be specified]
- K-points: [to be specified]
- Convergence: [to be specified]
- Optimization of clean surface and adsorbates
- Adsorption energy: 
  \[ E_{ads} = E_{slab+adsorbate} - E_{slab} - E_{adsorbate} \]

## Project Structure 
To be specified.

## Status
> **In progress** — The project is at an early stage with many key components still under development.
